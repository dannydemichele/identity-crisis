# Identity Crisis

Try it out on [Github pages](https://wes337.github.io/identity-crisis/)!

The hard work of your life is no longer work. You eat food from a frozen yogurt tube. It's green, it's got nutrients, it's based on insects. But you don't mind because it's flavored with Splenda, aspartame, and Stevia. And it's actually good for you. Your job is completely taken over by a computer. There are self-driving cars and machines that masturbate for you. The last thing you need help with is your identity. Your personality. Your opinion. Your forum posts. Your dating profile. What do you say on your dating profile to let your mate know that you are compassionate, that you care about other people, that you're a good person, and that you have the right beliefs?

## To do

- Write actual documentation explaining each feature.
- ~~Clean up code. It's a huge mess since I wrote it all in a single day, and have no intentions for anyone else to actually look at this code. CSS especially.~~
- Add a "Copy to clipboard" button
- Add way to change GPT-3 models (maybe)
- Add a "LinkedIn" headline generator
